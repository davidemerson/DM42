# DM42
A repository of packages I use on my SwissMicros DM42. Some of these I wrote, some of these I collected from elsewhere. I keep them here because it's a good place to back them up in case the calculator goes haywire.

## Sources
Many of these programs were written by Thomas Okken, and hosted in an excellent repository (https://technical.swissmicros.com/dm42/fat/PROGRAMS/) by SwissMicros.

## Converting to .raw
If you want to package a program for the DM42, do it here: https://technical.swissmicros.com/decoders/dm42/

## Installing
Just plug in the DM42, mount as a USB disk, and drag these to the PROGRAMS folder.
